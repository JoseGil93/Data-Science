* This Repository contains 2 Projects that I have developed in this Unit during my Master's Degree:
* I have developed the following projects in Python through Jupyter and Spyder in Anaconda.

1. 
* In this project, the dataset contains 8x8 pixel images of 0-9 digits, as unstructured Data with more than 1.500 instance in every file.
An Unsupervised Learning Task was developed, by using K-Means algorithm with Euclidean Distance for Clustering and PCA for Dimensionality Reduction.
The PCA was plot in a Scatter Plot.
