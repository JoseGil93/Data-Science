# Data-Science

* This Repository contains 2 Projects that I have developed in this Unit during my Master's Degree:
* I have developed the following projects in Python through Jupyter and Spyder in Anaconda.

1. [Wine Rating Analysis for Hotel Services: Text Analysis](https://github.com/JoseGil93/Data-Science/blob/master/Wine%20Rating%20Analysis%20for%20Hotels.pdf)
* In this project, the dataset contains more tan 129.900 instances in a Json File. 
* The dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which was used in a Kaggle Competition. 
* First of all, the data was cleaned and explored by using a descriptive statistics summary table, then the most popular wines were retrieved by taking into account and selecting two main feautures. After finding this information, a recommendation was given to the Client. 
* Secondly, a text analysis task was performed, for this it was required to tokenize the categorical data from the reviews in order to split the strings and retrieve the suitable data, which was saved in two txt files, one for the keywords in more than 5.000 reviews and the other for the tf-idf by using vectorizer with a score higher than 0.4. This in order to get and analyse the words more used in the customers reviews that will help the business to make better decisions for improving the services offered. 

2. [Marketing Campaing of a Potuguese Bank]()
* In this project, the dataset contains more tan 45.200 instances in a CSV Files. 
* The objective of this project is to analyse the data to design strategies for future marketing campaigns. The data collected is related to marketing campaigns based on phone calls. Thus, the datasets have the information collected from the phone calls.
* This dataset was uploaded in the UCI Machine Learning Reporsitory and used in the Kaggle Competition. 
* To perform this task, it was used Apache Spark. 
* First of all, the data was explored, then, it was performed a Feature Engineering, and the main attributes were selected, the data was cleaned and the categorical attributes selected were transformed to numerical attributes, one hot encoded was applied and the data was normalized during the feauture engineering process. 
* Then, the Principal Component Analysis, PCA, was also performed after applying K-Means for clustering of Unsupervised Learning. 
* Finally, Supervised Learning algorithms were used for the multiclass classification such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree, in order to get meaningful insights for design better strategies for the marketing campaigns.
